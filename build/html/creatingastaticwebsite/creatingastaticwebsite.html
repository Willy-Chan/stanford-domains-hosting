<span id="h-phvuhp7a2dfh"></span><h2>What is a static website?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-static-website" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A static website is a website that is made up of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript files that are stored on a web server and served to users
as-is. Unlike dynamic websites (like those made from Wordpress), which
use databases and server-side programming to generate content on the
fly, static websites arepre-built and cannot be modified by users.</p>
<p>Essentially, a static website is like a set of pages that are already
printed out and cannot be changed. When a user visits a static website,
they see exactly what the website owner has created, without any
interactivity or dynamic content.</p>
<p>Overall, static websites are best suited for websites that don't require
complex functionality or frequent updates, but need to be fast,
reliable, and secure. They are an excellent option for small businesses,
individuals, or organizations that need a simple, effective online
presence.</p>

<section id="who-should-use-a-static-website">
<span id="h-ve6v2p19tli5"></span><h2>Who should use a static website?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-should-use-a-static-website" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Pros of using a static website:</p>
<p>Simplicity: Static websites are simple to set up, manage, and deploy,
and do not require any special technical skills or knowledge.</p>
<p>Speed: Static websites load faster than dynamic websites like WordPress,
which can improve user experience and search engine ranking.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Security: Static websites are less susceptible to security
vulnerabilities and attacks than dynamic websites, as there are fewer
components and plugins to exploit.</p>
<p>Cost: Static websites are generally less expensive to host and maintain
than dynamic websites like WordPress, as they require fewer resources.</p>
<p>Reliability: Static websites are reliable and consistent, as they do not
rely on external databases or plugins that can fail or break.</p>
<p>Cons of using a static website:</p>
<p>Limited functionality: Static websites are limited in terms of
functionality and cannot provide dynamic features like e-commerce, user
registration, or commenting.</p>
<p>Customization: Static websites are more difficult to customize and
update than dynamic websites, as changes must be made to the HTML and
CSS code.</p>
<p>Content management: Static websites do not have a built-in content
management system like WordPress, which can make it difficult to manage
and update content.</p>
<p>Scalability: Static websites may not be as easily scalable as dynamic
websites, as they require manual updates to accommodate growth.</p>
<p>Search engine optimization (SEO): Static websites require additional
manual optimization to improve their search engine ranking, as they do
not have built-in SEO tools like WordPress.</p>

<p>To host a static website in cPanel, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Log in to your cPanel account. The details of creating one are
covered earlier in this guide.</p></li>
<li><p>Once logged in, navigate to the &quot;File Manager&quot; option. It is usually
located in the &quot;Files&quot; section.</p></li>
<li><p>In the File Manager, you'll see a directory structure. Look for the
&quot;public_html&quot; directory or a similar folder. This is the root
directory for your website.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the &quot;public_html&quot; directory to open it. If you want to host
the website in a subdirectory, create a new folder within the
&quot;public_html&quot; directory and enter that folder instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload your static website files to the appropriate directory. To do
this, click on the &quot;Upload&quot; button in the top toolbar. You can then
select the files from your computer and upload them.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the files are uploaded, you can access your website by entering
your domain name in a web browser. For example, if your domain is
&quot;example.com,&quot; enter
&quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://example.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1683240352566198&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oGt9a2XzSXFHaug6Aci3R">http://example.com</a>&quot;
in the browser's address bar.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to use a specific file as your website's default page
(e.g., &quot;index.html&quot;), make sure it is named correctly. By default,
cPanel looks for an &quot;index.html&quot; file in the directory and displays
it as the main page. You can also set custom default page settings in
cPanel if needed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Your static website should now be hosted and accessible
through your domain. Remember to update your DNS settings if necessary
to ensure that your domain points to your hosting account.</p>

<p>Although Stanford domains offers free website hosting services, there
may be cases where you want to host a static website outside of Stanford
domains. Some reasons for doing so may include:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Flexibility: Hosting a website outside of Stanford domains gives you
more flexibility to customize and control your website hosting
environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>Cost: Hosting a website outside of Stanford domains may be more
cost-effective, especially if you need a website with high traffic or
complex functionality that requires more resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Features: Hosting a website outside of Stanford domains may give you
access to additional features, tools, and resources that are not
available on Stanford's platform.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If you do decide to host your static website outside of Stanford
domains, there are several options available to you, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>GitHub Pages: GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows you
to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service that can be used to
host static websites. It offers low cost and high scalability, making
it a good option for websites with high traffic or storage needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Google Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage is another cloud storage
service that can be used to host static websites. It offers low cost
and high scalability, as well as advanced features like automatic
backups and versioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Netlify: Netlify is a platform that offers hosting, build automation,
and other tools for static websites. It is easy to use and offers
advanced features like continuous deployment and serverless
functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while Stanford domains offers free and reliable website hosting
services, there may be cases where you want to host your static website
outside of the platform. There are several options available, each with
its own benefits and features, so it's important to choose the one that
best meets your needs and budget.</p>
