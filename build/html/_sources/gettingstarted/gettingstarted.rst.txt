Create a Head Domain
--------------------

#. Go to\ `this
   website <https://www.google.com/url?q=https://domains.stanford.edu/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683240352551382&usg=AOvVaw1cpvXid43BsIU-95aR1TD->`__\  and
   click “Get Started” (the button circled in red).

2. Login with your SUNet ID and complete the prompts. When naming your
   “primary” domain,note that this CANNOT be changed so choose wisely!

#. We recommend naming the primary domain your SUNet name, however you
   can choose whatever name you want.Instructions to change the domain
   to a proper .stanford.edu address are located later in this document!
#. If you wish to change the domain name later, you will have to open a
   request ticket in a lengthy process that could threaten the security
   of your website. Instructions to do so are located later in this
   document.
#. Contact the Cardinal Labs Team if you have any questions about
   setting up your own Stanford domains!

| Your website URL will have the following structure:                   |
|                                                                       |
| <name of your primary domain>.su.domains/<name of your website>       |
|                                                                       |
| e.g.                                                                  |
|                                                                       |
