Description
-----------

Stanford Domains is a web hosting service offered by Stanford University
that allows students, faculty, and staff to create and maintain their
own personal websites. Users are provided with a domain name and web
space to build their site using various tools and platforms such as
WordPress, Drupal, and HTML/CSS.

Stanford Domains is available to all students, faculty, and staff at no
cost. This makes it an ideal service for many Cardinal Labs clients, as
having an official Stanford domain name can lend credibility to the
organization associated with it.
