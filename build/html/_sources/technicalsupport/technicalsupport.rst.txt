Website Audit
-------------

-  Once a year, the Stanford Domains IT department conducts an in-depth
   audit to phase out unused websites and wordpress materials. So, once
   a year, make sure to look out for an email asking you to confirm that
   you’re still using and maintaining your websites!

Troubleshooting cPanel
----------------------

-  Because cPanel manages all the applications used by Stanford Domains,
   you are forced to accept and installall new upgrades and updates to
   the platform.

-  This means that you are responsible forupdating all the plugins
   used on your Wordpress website - some plugins may not be allowed on
   older templates. If you run into an issue with a specific
   feature,contact the Stanford Domains IT Department orCardinal
   Labs for technical support.

-  Your site must be compatible withPHP 8.1. This can mean that
   transferring/transitioning an older site to Stanford Domains can
   cause compatibility issues.

-  If you are locked out of your cPanel or forget your administrative
   password, contactCardinal Labs orStanford IT Department for
   assistance.
