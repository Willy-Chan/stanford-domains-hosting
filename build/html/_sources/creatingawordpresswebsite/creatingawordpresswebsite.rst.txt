Who should use Wordpress?
-------------------------

Pros of using a WordPress website:

#. ContentManagementSystem: WordPress is a popular content management
   system thatmakes it relatively simple forusers to create, edit, and
   publishcontent without any coding skills (although changing aspects
   of the website design itself may take more knowledge).

2. Scalability: WordPress websites are easily scalable, which means they
   can better handle large amounts of traffic and can be expanded as the
   website grows.

3. Search engine optimization (SEO): WordPress has built-in SEO tools
   that help optimize the website for search engines, which can improve
   the website's visibility and ranking.

4. Support: WordPress has a large community of developers and usersand
   is well-established as a website creation tool. This provides you
   with long-term support with the assistance ofCardinal Labs if your
   organization wishes to change major features of the website in the
   future.

Cons of using a WordPress website:

#. Complexity: Although WordPress is relatively easy to use, it can be
   complex for beginners to set up and customize, and may require some
   technical knowledge to manage effectively.

2. Maintenance: WordPress requires regular updates and maintenance to
   keep it secure and up-to-date, which can potentially cause downtime,
   be time-consuming, and require technical expertise.

3. Security: WordPress is a popular platform and is therefore a common
   target for hackers, so users must take additional security measures
   to protect their website from vulnerabilities and threats.

4. Cost: While WordPress itself is free, users may need to purchase
   premium themes and plugins to get the features they need, which can
   add up over time.

5. Performance: WordPress can be resource-intensive and may slow down
   the website's performance if not optimized properly.

\**Installing the Cardinal Labs Template
----------------------------------------

Before we dive into the steps for installing a custom template to your
WordPress website, it's important to note that although the default
version of WordPress' built-in theme and website builder can be used to
create a website, it may not look unique or have all the design features
you require.Cardinal Labs provides plenty of extra theme options, color
palettes, tools, and design knowledge that can help you customize your
website to meet your needs and stand out from the crowd!

Now, let's move on to the steps for installing a custom template to
WordPress:

Step 1: Choose your template

First, you'll need to choose a custom template that you want to install
on your WordPress website. You can purchase templates from third-party
websites like ThemeForest, or you can use a free template from the
WordPress repository. We highly recommend utilizing the sophisticated
theme developed byCardinal Labs, developed specifically for Stanford
VSOs!

Step 2: Download the template

Once you've chosen your template, you'll need to download it to your
computer. The template will usually be in a zip file format.

Step 3: Log in to your WordPress dashboard

Next, log in to your WordPress dashboard. You can do this by adding
/wp-admin to the end of your website URL.

Step 4: Go to the Appearance section

From the WordPress dashboard, go to the "Appearance" section and click
on "Themes."

Step 5: Upload the template

On the Themes page, click the "Add New" button at the top of the page.
Next, click the "Upload Theme" button, and then click the "Choose File"
button to browse your computer for the template zip file you downloaded
in Step 2. Once you've selected the file, click the "Install Now"
button.

Step 6: Activate the template

After the template is installed, click the "Activate" button to activate
it on your website.

Step 7: Customize the template

Once you've activated the template, you can customize it to meet your
specific needs. Depending on the template you chose, you may have access
to customization options through the WordPress Customizer or through the
template's own customization panel.

That's it! You've now installed and activated a custom template on your
WordPress website and can start customizing it to your liking.
