Creating a Wordpress Website
============================

.. _h.xaxhz9oyb4mo:

Who should use Wordpress?
-------------------------

Pros of using a WordPress website:

#. ContentManagementSystem: WordPress is a popular content management
   system thatmakes it relatively simple forusers to create, edit, and
   publishcontent without any coding skills (although changing aspects
   of the website design itself may take more knowledge).

2. Scalability: WordPress websites are easily scalable, which means they
   can better handle large amounts of traffic and can be expanded as the
   website grows.

3. Search engine optimization (SEO): WordPress has built-in SEO tools
   that help optimize the website for search engines, which can improve
   the website's visibility and ranking.

4. Support: WordPress has a large community of developers and usersand
   is well-established as a website creation tool. This provides you
   with long-term support with the assistance ofCardinal Labs if your
   organization wishes to change major features of the website in the
   future.

Cons of using a WordPress website:

#. Complexity: Although WordPress is relatively easy to use, it can be
   complex for beginners to set up and customize, and may require some
   technical knowledge to manage effectively.

2. Maintenance: WordPress requires regular updates and maintenance to
   keep it secure and up-to-date, which can potentially cause downtime,
   be time-consuming, and require technical expertise.

3. Security: WordPress is a popular platform and is therefore a common
   target for hackers, so users must take additional security measures
   to protect their website from vulnerabilities and threats.

4. Cost: While WordPress itself is free, users may need to purchase
   premium themes and plugins to get the features they need, which can
   add up over time.

5. Performance: WordPress can be resource-intensive and may slow down
   the website's performance if not optimized properly.

\**Installing the Cardinal Labs Template
----------------------------------------

Before we dive into the steps for installing a custom template to your
WordPress website, it's important to note that although the default
version of WordPress' built-in theme and website builder can be used to
create a website, it may not look unique or have all the design features
you require.Cardinal Labs provides plenty of extra theme options, color
palettes, tools, and design knowledge that can help you customize your
website to meet your needs and stand out from the crowd!

Now, let's move on to the steps for installing a custom template to
WordPress:

Step 1: Choose your template

First, you'll need to choose a custom template that you want to install
on your WordPress website. You can purchase templates from third-party
websites like ThemeForest, or you can use a free template from the
WordPress repository. We highly recommend utilizing the sophisticated
theme developed byCardinal Labs, developed specifically for Stanford
VSOs!

Step 2: Download the template

Once you've chosen your template, you'll need to download it to your
computer. The template will usually be in a zip file format.

Step 3: Log in to your WordPress dashboard

Next, log in to your WordPress dashboard. You can do this by adding
/wp-admin to the end of your website URL.

Step 4: Go to the Appearance section

From the WordPress dashboard, go to the "Appearance" section and click
on "Themes."

Step 5: Upload the template

On the Themes page, click the "Add New" button at the top of the page.
Next, click the "Upload Theme" button, and then click the "Choose File"
button to browse your computer for the template zip file you downloaded
in Step 2. Once you've selected the file, click the "Install Now"
button.

Step 6: Activate the template

After the template is installed, click the "Activate" button to activate
it on your website.

Step 7: Customize the template

Once you've activated the template, you can customize it to meet your
specific needs. Depending on the template you chose, you may have access
to customization options through the WordPress Customizer or through the
template's own customization panel.

That's it! You've now installed and activated a custom template on your
WordPress website and can start customizing it to your liking.

Creating a Static Website
=========================

.. _h.phvuhp7a2dfh:

What is a static website?
-------------------------

A static website is a website that is made up of HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript files that are stored on a web server and served to users
as-is. Unlike dynamic websites (like those made from Wordpress), which
use databases and server-side programming to generate content on the
fly, static websites arepre-built and cannot be modified by users.

Essentially, a static website is like a set of pages that are already
printed out and cannot be changed. When a user visits a static website,
they see exactly what the website owner has created, without any
interactivity or dynamic content.

Overall, static websites are best suited for websites that don't require
complex functionality or frequent updates, but need to be fast,
reliable, and secure. They are an excellent option for small businesses,
individuals, or organizations that need a simple, effective online
presence.

.. _h.ve6v2p19tli5:

Who should use a static website?
--------------------------------

Pros of using a static website:

Simplicity: Static websites are simple to set up, manage, and deploy,
and do not require any special technical skills or knowledge.

Speed: Static websites load faster than dynamic websites like WordPress,
which can improve user experience and search engine ranking.

--------------

Security: Static websites are less susceptible to security
vulnerabilities and attacks than dynamic websites, as there are fewer
components and plugins to exploit.

Cost: Static websites are generally less expensive to host and maintain
than dynamic websites like WordPress, as they require fewer resources.

Reliability: Static websites are reliable and consistent, as they do not
rely on external databases or plugins that can fail or break.

Cons of using a static website:

Limited functionality: Static websites are limited in terms of
functionality and cannot provide dynamic features like e-commerce, user
registration, or commenting.

Customization: Static websites are more difficult to customize and
update than dynamic websites, as changes must be made to the HTML and
CSS code.

Content management: Static websites do not have a built-in content
management system like WordPress, which can make it difficult to manage
and update content.

Scalability: Static websites may not be as easily scalable as dynamic
websites, as they require manual updates to accommodate growth.

Search engine optimization (SEO): Static websites require additional
manual optimization to improve their search engine ranking, as they do
not have built-in SEO tools like WordPress.

Static hosting via Stanford Domains
-----------------------------------

To host a static website in cPanel, you can follow these steps:

#. Log in to your cPanel account. The details of creating one are
   covered earlier in this guide.
#. Once logged in, navigate to the "File Manager" option. It is usually
   located in the "Files" section.
#. In the File Manager, you'll see a directory structure. Look for the
   "public_html" directory or a similar folder. This is the root
   directory for your website.
#. Click on the "public_html" directory to open it. If you want to host
   the website in a subdirectory, create a new folder within the
   "public_html" directory and enter that folder instead.
#. Upload your static website files to the appropriate directory. To do
   this, click on the "Upload" button in the top toolbar. You can then
   select the files from your computer and upload them.
#. Once the files are uploaded, you can access your website by entering
   your domain name in a web browser. For example, if your domain is
   "example.com," enter
   "\ `http://example.com <https://www.google.com/url?q=http://example.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1683240352566198&usg=AOvVaw2oGt9a2XzSXFHaug6Aci3R>`__\ "
   in the browser's address bar.
#. If you want to use a specific file as your website's default page
   (e.g., "index.html"), make sure it is named correctly. By default,
   cPanel looks for an "index.html" file in the directory and displays
   it as the main page. You can also set custom default page settings in
   cPanel if needed.

That's it! Your static website should now be hosted and accessible
through your domain. Remember to update your DNS settings if necessary
to ensure that your domain points to your hosting account.

.. _h.37lelb1847p0:

Hosting via External Service
----------------------------

Although Stanford domains offers free website hosting services, there
may be cases where you want to host a static website outside of Stanford
domains. Some reasons for doing so may include:

#. Flexibility: Hosting a website outside of Stanford domains gives you
   more flexibility to customize and control your website hosting
   environment.

2. Cost: Hosting a website outside of Stanford domains may be more
   cost-effective, especially if you need a website with high traffic or
   complex functionality that requires more resources.

3. Features: Hosting a website outside of Stanford domains may give you
   access to additional features, tools, and resources that are not
   available on Stanford's platform.

If you do decide to host your static website outside of Stanford
domains, there are several options available to you, including:

-  GitHub Pages: GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows you
   to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.
-  Amazon S3: Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service that can be used to
   host static websites. It offers low cost and high scalability, making
   it a good option for websites with high traffic or storage needs.
-  Google Cloud Storage: Google Cloud Storage is another cloud storage
   service that can be used to host static websites. It offers low cost
   and high scalability, as well as advanced features like automatic
   backups and versioning.
-  Netlify: Netlify is a platform that offers hosting, build automation,
   and other tools for static websites. It is easy to use and offers
   advanced features like continuous deployment and serverless
   functions.

Overall, while Stanford domains offers free and reliable website hosting
services, there may be cases where you want to host your static website
outside of the platform. There are several options available, each with
its own benefits and features, so it's important to choose the one that
best meets your needs and budget.

Technical Support
=================

.. _h.ym6gyoijlu8y:

Website Audit
-------------

-  Once a year, the Stanford Domains IT department conducts an in-depth
   audit to phase out unused websites and wordpress materials. So, once
   a year, make sure to look out for an email asking you to confirm that
   you’re still using and maintaining your websites!

.. _h.821mtmr2unnm:

Troubleshooting cPanel
----------------------

-  Because cPanel manages all the applications used by Stanford Domains,
   you are forced to accept and installall new upgrades and updates to
   the platform.

-  This means that you are responsible forupdating all the plugins
   used on your Wordpress website - some plugins may not be allowed on
   older templates. If you run into an issue with a specific
   feature,contact the Stanford Domains IT Department orCardinal
   Labs for technical support.

-  Your site must be compatible withPHP 8.1. This can mean that
   transferring/transitioning an older site to Stanford Domains can
   cause compatibility issues.

-  If you are locked out of your cPanel or forget your administrative
   password, contactCardinal Labs orStanford IT Department for
   assistance.
