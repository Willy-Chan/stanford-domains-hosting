# Guide to Stanford Domains
This documentation is meant to be read by Stanford students and organizations looking for a free, university-affiliated hosting solution for personal projects, VSO websites, and small-scale web applications.

## Getting Started
Stanford Domains is a free, self-service web publishing tool used to create personal digital spaces for various media, such as portfolios and wikis. Stanford students, faculty, and staff can register a free subdomain (mysubdomain.su.domains) and install WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, or other popular open-source applications.

_Important Note:_ In September 2023, some rates will change for some of the technology services provided by University IT. To view the majority of the planned rate changes for services that are broadly available to Stanford's community, please visit [this page](https://uit.stanford.edu/FY24Changes). For current rate information, visit [this website](https://uit.stanford.edu/rates) for the most current university rates.
